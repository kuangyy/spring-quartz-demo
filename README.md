Quartz Enterprise Job Scheduler
What is the Quartz Job Scheduling Library?
Quartz is a richly featured, open source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the largest e-commerce system. Quartz can be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard Java components that may execute virtually anything you may program them to do. The Quartz Scheduler includes many enterprise-class features, such as support for JTA transactions and clustering.

Quartz is freely usable, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

What Can Quartz Do For You?
If your application has tasks that need to occur at given moments in time, or if your system has recurring maintenance jobs then Quartz may be your ideal solution.

Sample uses of job scheduling with Quartz:

Driving Process Workflow: As a new order is initially placed, schedule a Job to fire in exactly 2 hours, that will check the status of that order, and trigger a warning notification if an order confirmation message has not yet been received for the order, as well as changing the order’s status to ‘awaiting intervention’.
System Maintenance: Schedule a job to dump the contents of a database into an XML file every business day (all weekdays except holidays) at 11:30 PM.
Providing reminder services within an application.
